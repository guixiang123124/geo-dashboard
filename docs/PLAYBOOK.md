# GEO Optimization Playbook

This playbook maps the **Measurement Dimensions** to **Actionable Optimization Tactics**.

## 🔴 Problem: Low Visibility (Recall)
**Symptom**: AI doesn't mention your brand in "Best of" lists.

### 🛠️ Optimization Actions
1.  **Category Definition**: Ensure your Homepage H1 and Title Tag explicitly state your primary category (e.g., "Kids Sustainable Fashion" vs "Cute Clothes").
2.  **Listicle Formatting**: Create internal content that structures your products as list items. AI loves to scrape structured lists.
3.  **Co-occurrence**: Get mentioned on 3rd party "Best X" lists. AI reads those to learn who belongs in the set.

## 🔴 Problem: Low Citation (Authority)
**Symptom**: AI mentions you but links to Amazon/Target or a blog instead of your site.

### 🛠️ Optimization Actions
1.  **Factual Density**: Add an "About Us" or "Technology/Materials" page rich in static facts (Founded date, Material composition, Safety certs). AI cites facts, not fluff.
2.  **URL Structure**: Use clear, semantic URLs (`/kids-safety-standards` vs `/page-123`).
3.  **Static HTML**: Ensure key informational content is server-side rendered, not buried in complex JavaScript.

## 🔴 Problem: Poor Representation (Framing)
**Symptom**: AI calls you "Cheap" when you are "Affordable Luxury", or misses your "Sustainable" angle.

### 🛠️ Optimization Actions
1.  **The "One-Liner"**: Place a clear, definitive definition of your brand in the Footer or About section. "Brand X is the leading provider of affordable organic cotton wear."
2.  **Consistency**: Audit product pages. If 50% say "Cheap" and 50% say "Value", AI gets confused. Unify terminology.
3.  **Disambiguation**: If you share a name with another entity, explicitly state "Not to be confused with..." or use schema markup.

## 🔴 Problem: Low Intent Coverage
**Symptom**: You appear for "Kids Clothes" but vanish for "Back to School Outfits".

### 🛠️ Optimization Actions
1.  **Contextual Hubs**: Create pages specifically for these intents (e.g., a "Back to School Guide").
2.  **FAQ Sections**: Add FAQs addressing specific needs ("Do you have sizes for toddlers?", "Is this durable for playground?").
3.  **Long-tail Keywords**: Ensure product descriptions include intent-based keywords ("Perfect for holiday parties", "Durable for active play").
